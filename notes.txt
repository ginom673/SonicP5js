NOTE: in general, we seem to check for collisions, then draw, then autoscroll ... it would be good to keep that order standardized

NOTE: later add code to terminate spindash after a certain amount of time ... this code may need to consider our current state before getting out of spindash

BUG: hitbox is slightly off when we jump
BUG: acceleration bug ... sonic continues going right/left when you press both arrow keys at nearly the same time
BUG: something was strange with slopes ... entering/leaving, acceleration, something like that
