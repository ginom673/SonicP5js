// NOTES

// we will basically have a big list of platforms
// platforms = [];
// we will have a class for platform too, which means we add platform objects to the platforms list
// using camera controls, we determine which of the platforms are currently visible
// and where those platforms are positioned
// we will constantly be checking how (if at all) Sonic collides with any of the platforms
